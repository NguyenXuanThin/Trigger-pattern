#1 Trigger Handler Pattern

The Trigger Handler pattern is a best practice for managing Apex triggers in the Salesforce platform. This pattern helps ensure the trigger code is well-organized, efficient, and maintainable.

## Advantage of Trigger Handler pattern

* Apex Class that handles trigger logic
* Allows code to be called from other code or tests
* Uses specific Trigger contexts and Trigger variables for routing
* Keep Triggers Simple
* Allow for greater flexibility
* Make code reusable
* Unit tests are much easier

## Here are a few best practices for triggers in Salesforce:

* **Bulkify your Code:** Always write triggers that can handle multiple records at a time to respect Salesforce’s governor limits.
* **Avoid Recursive Triggers:** Ensure your trigger doesn’t re-fire itself, leading to an infinite loop.
* **One Trigger per Object:** To keep better control of the order of operations, it’s recommended to have only one trigger per object.
* **Keep Business Logic in Helper Classes:** Instead of writing all the business logic inside the trigger, write the logic in a separate class and call this class from the trigger.
* **Test Coverage:** Always aim for a minimum of 75% test coverage to ensure the trigger works as expected.
* **Error Handling:** Include proper error handling to display meaningful error messages to the end user.

## There are several limitations of triggers in Salesforce:

* **Governor Limits:** Salesforce enforces various limits on the number of database operations, the amount of CPU time, and the memory capacity that triggers can use.
* **Order of Execution:** The order in which triggers are executed can’t be explicitly controlled.
* **Testing and Deployment:** Triggers must have at least 75% test coverage in order to be deployed to a production environment.
* **Recursive Triggers:** Avoiding recursive triggers can be complex. If the same trigger is fired continuously, you may run into infinite loops.
* **Complexity:** Triggers can become complex, especially as more business logic is added. This can lead to difficult-to-maintain code.
## Note:
  This pattern can aplly interface to implement method.
